# MS-DOS Command Parser

A simple Python Program for parsing MS-DOS style command-line strings.

This library takes a command-line string as input and parses it into a command and a list of arguments, handling quotes and switches similar to how `cmd.exe` would.

## Features

*   Parses a command-line string into a command and arguments.
*   Correctly handles arguments enclosed in double quotes.
*   Supports MS-DOS/Windows style switches (e.g., `/P`, `/O:N`).
*   Lightweight and has no external dependencies.

## Usage

```
python main.py
```
